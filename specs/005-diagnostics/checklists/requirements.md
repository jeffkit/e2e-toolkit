# Specification Quality Checklist: Intelligent Diagnostics & Suggestions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for the planning phase.
- Built-in patterns are enumerated in FR-006 and detailed in the feature description for implementation reference.
- The spec references the existing persistence layer (completed in feature 004-history) as a dependency.
- Confidence calculation formula is left to implementation — the spec only requires that confidence reflects resolution success rate (FR-009, SC-004).
